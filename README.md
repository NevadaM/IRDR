# IRDR - Decision Making Algorithms
A repo where I converted the prof's Decision Making Algorithm code from MATLAB to python.

#### decisionmodule.py
* The location of code for AHP, TOPSIS and User Input (which is bugged right now)
* Uses numpy and pandas dependencies, and optionally matplotlib
* Mostly commented

#### example.py 
* An example script using the work of Caterino et al (2008)
* Performs AHP and TOPSIS
* Will plot spider diagram - change key word arguments of topsis to also plot bar charts of weighted normalised criteria values.
* Also prints the results dataframe
